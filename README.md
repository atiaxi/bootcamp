This is a python script which ingests food review data captured from Amazon.com

The demo requires the Python framework Flask and the cassandra driver.

* OSX Install:
* Weâ€™re going to need the python cassandra driver.  For that we need pip:
 * `sudo easy_install pip`
* We also need a newer version of python setuptools:
 * `sudo easy_install -U setuptools`
* And now you can get the driver:
 * `sudo pip install cassandra-driver`
* And get flask
 * `sudo pip install flask`
